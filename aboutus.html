    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Founded in 2022, Scholio.com has helped students find money for college and learn about the entire financial aid process.
      We are among the most widely-used and trusted free college scholarship search and
      financial aid information resources on the Internet and have been recognized by high schools,
      colleges and universities nationwide, among others.
      We’ve built solid relationships with colleges and universities across the country and want to provide students
      with the opportunity to not only find free money for college and interact with prospective colleges but to be recruited as well.
    </p><br>
    <h3>We are the best.</h3><br>
    Scholio.com has been matching students to scholarships for over two decades.
    Our scholarship providers LOVE getting your inquiries and applications.
    We are not just churning out a list of extremely general and competitive scholarships so commonly found on the internet.
    We have spent the better part of the last two decades creating the best scholarship database on the internet.<br><br>
    <h3>We update our scholarship data daily.</h3><br>
    Our hard-working, dedicated staff is adding and updating scholarships in our database daily.
    We respond to feedback quickly and are constantly morphing into the next, better iteration of ourselves.
    We keep viable scholarships updated and discard any that appear to be inactive. We understand the scholarship cycle.
    Most are annual and not all are on the same schedule. We adapt and adjust so you won’t have to.<br><br>
    <h3>Scholarships for college students? Absolutely.</h3><br>
    College scholarships aren't just for high school seniors.
    Many of our users are already enrolled in college and are looking for money for the next semester or academic year.
    Whether you are in high school, college or grad school and regardless of your age,
    there are scholarships in our database for you.<br><br>
    <h3>I’m only a high school freshman. What about me?</h3><br>
    Congratulations! You are starting your scholarship search at a time many students wished they started theirs!
    There may not be as many scholarships for high school freshmen as there are for seniors, but they are not as competitive,
    either! Plus, you can get an early start learning about the process of finding free money for college.
    You will have an edge on all the others who waited until much later to start searching.<br><br>
    <h3>It’s too much work. So many essays, videos, etc.</h3><br>
    Don’t be discouraged. Be organized and efficient and you are bound to win some scholarships!
    Select all the scholarships you want to apply for initially and compare them.
    Many of them will ask similar questions and you will most likely be able to use a single essay for more than one,
    possibly several different scholarships. Work smarter, not harder!<br><br>
